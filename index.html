        <h2>📜 Get to Know Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Chicago resident who grew up in Alabama, where I worked in news, communications, and even school bus driving before learning to code.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned React.js, Node.js, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the Innovate Bham coding bootcamp. Since then, I've earned professional experience in React Native, Google Firebase, and Next.js, and now I'm working to learn Python. This site is built with three.js and Vite.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm currently available for contract work and full-time employment! I'm most interested in coding roles, but I'd love to bring my comms skills along for the ride.
