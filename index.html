        <h2>üìú Get to Know Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Chicago resident who grew up in Alabama, where I worked in news, communications, and even school bus driving before learning to code.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned React.js, Node.js, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the Innovate Bham coding bootcamp. Since then, I've earned professional experience in React Native, Google Firebase, and Next.js. This site is built with three.js and Vite.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I've recently completed a highly competitive Software Development Apprenticeship at the University of Illinois's Discovery Partners Institute. We studied Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, SQLite, JavaScript, and more during this program.
        </p>
                
        <p>
          I'm also working on Georgia Tech's Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java certificate program.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm currently available for contract work and full-time employment! I'm most interested in coding roles, but I'd love to offer comms solutions as well. Technical writer roles, customer success roles, I'm happy to do anything on my path to development.
        </p>
